# YouTube Comments Spam Classifier

### YouTube Walkthrough
* available [here](https://youtu.be/FmmlHbHqgGY)

### Limitations
* dataset only comes from comments on music videos of five artists so the model may not perform as expected in other contexts (e.g. a tech video)
* what is considered spam in one context may just as well be considered non-spam in a different context
